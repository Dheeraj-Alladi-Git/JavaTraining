1.  Difference between ArrayList and Linked List?
->  ArrayList
    - Write cost is heavy
    - adding/deleting elements from middle/specific index is
    - Memory is less used
    - Accessing a element is fast
 => USE ArrayList when you have heavy read applications like just need to display the values
    like displaying in the amazon.

->  LinkedList
    - Write cost is less
    - Adding/deleting data elements from anywhere is easy and simple
    - Memory is more
    - Accessing a element is Heavy
=> USE LinkedList when there is heavy insertions or deletions happening.
